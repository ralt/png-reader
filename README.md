# png-reader

## Description

A binary that reads a PNG file and correctly interprets it.

For now, it doesn't do more than that. Maybe I'll use it to flip the colors of
pictures or whatever.

## Why not use libpng?

Because it is mostly a for fun project. I want to flip the bits and open them
wide out there to read them one by one. Just having fun.

Also, it lets me re-learn C and make sure I'm not so lost. (Hint: I was at the
beginning.)
